                <h2>The background for the period</h2>
                <p>Tekhelet accompanied the people of Israel from the beginning of our time as a nation. The Tekhelet,
                    which was considered a precious royal color, is mentioned in the description of the work of the Mishkan,
                    the
                    priestly clothes and the Mitzvah of Tzitzit. The Torah commands: "Speak to the children of Israel and
                    say to
                    them they should make Tzitzit on the corners of their clothes for their generations and put a Tekhelet
                    string on the
                    Tzitzit of the corner" (BaMidbar 15:36), and from that moment, Jews used Tekhelet and cast it in their
                    tassels.

                        expensive commodity in the Mediterranean world.

                        After defeating the enemy, Avraham was presented with a generous offering from the King of
                        Sedom. Yet, he declined to accept even the slightest trinket - neither a thread nor a sandal
                        strap. The Midrash credits this profound act of faith as the reason why Avraham's descendants
                        were privileged with the Mitzvah of tzitzit.

                        In the language of Accadian, these beautiful blue and purple fabrics were known as Ta-kil-tu and
                        Ar-ga-ma-nu. The earliest written instances of these terms were uncovered on tablets found in
                        El-Amarna, Egypt, dating to a period just after the time of Avraham. These precious items were
                        included in a lavish dowry bestowed upon the marriage of the Mitani princess to the Egyptian
                        prince.

                        result of this honesty, according to the Midrash, his descendants are granted the privilege of
                        adorning their attire with Tekhelet, a signifier of royal status.

                        As the Jews departed Egypt, they took silver and gold vessels and garments from the Egyptians.
                        Rashi, referencing the Midrash, emphasizes that these garments held a value surpassing even that
                        of the gold and silver. Perhaps these garments might have been used for the Tekhelet and
                        Argamman of the Mishkan. Notably, there have been times in history when fabrics like these were
                        worth up to 20 times their weight in gold!

                        Tekhelet shares its color with the vibrant Lapis lazuli gemstone, referred to as 'sappir' in the
                        Torah. The tablets, or 'luchot', were crafted from this 'sappir'. Beneath Hashem, there appeared a
                        pavement of sappir, its purity mirroring the ethereal sky. Tekhelet serves as a constant reminder of
                        the Torah and its sacred laws, as well as the divine majesty of God's holy throne.

                        sumptuous fabrics. These included the Meil (robe), the Ephod (apron), the Choshen (breastplate), and
                        the Tzitz (diadem). Notably, Tekhelet played an integral role in the composition of each of these
