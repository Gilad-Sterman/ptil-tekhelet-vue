                        The Minoans on the island of Crete, were the first to use Murex snails to dye fabric - around
                        the
                        time of the birth of Avraham. Once discovered these stunning purple and blue dyes became the
                        most
                        expensive commodity in the Mediterranean world.

                        After defeating the enemy, Avraham was presented with a generous offering from the King of
                        Sedom. Yet, he declined to accept even the slightest trinket - neither a thread nor a sandal
                        strap. The Midrash credits this profound act of faith as the reason why Avraham's descendants
                        were privileged with the Mitzvah of tzitzit.

                        In the language of Accadian, these beautiful blue and purple fabrics were known as Ta-kil-tu and
                        Ar-ga-ma-nu. The earliest written instances of these terms were uncovered on tablets found in
                        El-Amarna, Egypt, dating to a period just after the time of Avraham. These precious items were
                        included in a lavish dowry bestowed upon the marriage of the Mitani princess to the Egyptian
                        prince.

                        embodies greater righteousness than himself when she presents his "seal and braided cord". As a
                        result of this honesty, according to the Midrash, his descendants are granted the privilege of
                        adorning their attire with Tekhelet, a signifier of royal status.

                        of the Tekhelet dye.

                        As the Jews departed Egypt, they took silver and gold vessels and garments from the Egyptians.
                        Rashi, referencing the Midrash, emphasizes that these garments held a value surpassing even that
                        of the gold and silver. Perhaps these garments might have been used for the Tekhelet and
                        Argamman of the Mishkan. Notably, there have been times in history when fabrics like these were
                        worth up to 20 times their weight in gold!

                        Tekhelet shares its color with the vibrant Lapis lazuli gemstone, referred to as 'sappir' in the
                        Torah. The tablets, or 'luchot', were crafted from this 'sappir'. Beneath Hashem, there appeared a
                        pavement of sappir, its purity mirroring the ethereal sky. Tekhelet serves as a constant reminder of
                        the Torah and its sacred laws, as well as the divine majesty of God's holy throne.

                        of the Mishkan reflected the creation of the world itself; Hashem provided us with a beautiful place
                        to live and we reciprocate by channeling our resources, talents and ingenuity to create a symbolic

                        sumptuous fabrics. These included the Meil (robe), the Ephod (apron), the Choshen (breastplate), and
